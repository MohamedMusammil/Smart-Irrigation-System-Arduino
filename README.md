🌱 Smart Irrigation System using Arduino
📌 Project Overview
This project is a Smart Irrigation System developed as an undergraduate Arduino-based project. The system is designed to automate irrigation, enhance water efficiency, and protect crops using multiple sensors and control mechanisms.

⚙️ System Description
🔐 Gate Access Control
•	A keypad is used for secure access.
•	When the correct password is entered, a servo motor rotates to open the gate.
🌡️ Temperature Monitoring & Automatic Irrigation
•	An LM35 temperature sensor is used to measure the temperature near the plant.
•	If the temperature rises above a predefined threshold, the system automatically activates the water pump.
•	Water is supplied from the water tank to the plant without manual intervention.
💧 Water Tank Level Monitoring
•	The water level in the tank is monitored using transistors and resistors.
•	Three LED indicators show the water level status:
o	🔴 Low level
o	🟡 Medium level
o	🟢 High level
🚨 Animal Motion Detection & Alert System
•	A PIR motion sensor is used to detect animal movement near the field.
•	If motion is detected:
o	An alarm/buzzer is activated
o	A warning alert/message is triggered to notify the user
